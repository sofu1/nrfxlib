/** @brief Configures the Radio Notification signal.
 *
 * @note
 *      - The notification signal latency depends on the interrupt priority settings of IRQ used
 *        for notification signal.
 *      - To ensure that the radio notification signal behaves in a consistent way, the radio
 *        notifications must be configured when there is no protocol stack enabled.
 *        It is recommended that the radio notification signal is
 *        configured directly after the MPSL is enabled.
 *
 * @param[in]  type      Type of notification signal, see @ref MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_TYPES.
 *                       @ref MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_NONE shall be used to turn off radio
 *                       notification. Using @ref MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_DISTANCE_NONE is
 *                       recommended (but not required) to be used with
 *                       @ref MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_NONE.
 *
 * @param[in]  distance  Distance between the notification signal and start of radio activity,
 *                       see @ref MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_DISTANCES.
 *                       This parameter is ignored when @ref MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_NONE or
 *                       @ref MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_INT_ON_INACTIVE is used.
 *
 * @param[in]  notif_irq IRQ to pend as the radio notification signal, e.g SWI1_IRQn.
 *                       If the application uses IRQs that are already in use, e.g, RADIO_IRQn,
 *                       TIMER0_IQRn or similar, the behavior is undefined.
 *                       The interrupt priority level should be lower than priority level 0, that is,
 *                       a higher numerical priority value. The application is responsible for
 *                       setting the interrupt priority.
 *
 *
 * @retval - ::NRF_EINVAL Invalid parameters supplied.
 * @retval - ::NRF_EAGAIN A protocol stack or other SoftDevice is running. Stop all
 *                        running activities and retry.
 * @retval 0  Success
